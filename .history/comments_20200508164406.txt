    toggle font for dyslexic students. 


 Tictactoe code
 1.	Create else if statement for alpha beta If "s"=== "s" Return (•••). (DONE) 
 Create object where key value pairs are the alphabet  and its key value pair is morseCode (DONE) 
 2. create var wordDisplayBox = "".split(""); this whould split the word into an array of letter, then write additional function or use morsee where those letter are converted into morse code and displayed on the screen. 
 3. once diplayed on screen computer must watch BoardOne for any matches using const regex = /[A-Z]/g; const found = paragraph.match(regex); method from the baord to the wordDisplayBox array. 
 4. once computer finds one match with the same colors, it will apply the str.srtike() method, name the letter, give it to winning player and reset the baord. bdyucskcdbkscndujsk


 Board adjustments 
 	3 symboled letters = adjust board to 3x3x3
 	4 symbols adjust board to 4x4x4
 	Use .length to asses the number of symbols for that letter 
 	Use if and else if to determine if .length is === to 4 or 3 
 	then write a function to change board adjust board.

 How to get conversion letters  
 	DATABASE of words
 	Tables of levels of words and  categories.
 	Must be able to connect database to server to pull random words 

 from database 
 	Words must be given then split into individual letters,  
 	then reassembled as characters
 	Then displayed as morse code.  
 	Loop through object array, to find matching letters 
 	display their value to computer as morse coded word. 
 Random  words selectors and display
